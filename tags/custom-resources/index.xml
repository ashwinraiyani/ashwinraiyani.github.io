AWS CloudFormation offers an easy way to deploy a collection of related AWS and third-party resources, provision them faster, and manage them throughout their lifecycles, by treating infrastructure as code.
A CloudFormation template contains information for the desired resources and their dependencies so we can launch and configure them together as a stack. We can use templates to create, update, and delete an entire stack as a single unit, instead of managing resources individually.</description></item></channel></rss>
