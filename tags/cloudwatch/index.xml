Metrics are information around the performance of the systems.
Out of the box a few AWS services offer metrics at no cost for resources such as Ec2, EBS, and RDS. We can also switch to detailed monitoring for a couple of resources such as Ec2 to fetch more details around the performances, and the best thing is we can publish our own application metrics.
Amazon CloudWatch ingests all the metrics in the AWS account (both AWS resource metrics and application metrics) for searching, graphing, and alarms.</description></item></channel></rss>
