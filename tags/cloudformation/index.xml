Drift detection allows to identify either a stack&amp;rsquo;s actual configuration differs or has drifted, from its original deployed values. We can use CloudFormation to identify drift on an entire stack or resources within the stack
A resource is examined as drifted if its actual property values delta from the expected property values. This contains if the property or resource has been modified or deleted. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources have drifted</description></item><item><title>Deep-dive of custom resources in AWS Cloudformation ðŸ“Œ</title><link>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/cloudformation-custom-resources/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sanchitdilipjain.github.io/post/cloudformation-custom-resources/</guid><description>Cloudformation Custom resources What is AWS Cloudformation?
AWS CloudFormation offers an easy way to deploy a collection of related AWS and third-party resources, provision them faster, and manage them throughout their lifecycles, by treating infrastructure as code.
A CloudFormation template contains information for the desired resources and their dependencies so we can launch and configure them together as a stack. We can use templates to create, update, and delete an entire stack as a single unit, instead of managing resources individually.</description></item></channel></rss>
